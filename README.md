# Elevate Lab Internship
# Task 2: Creating a To-Do List Application (Console-based) 
# Below are the points which I learned from the to do list project
- learned how to use a Python list to store tasks while the program is running.
- explored how to add tasks with **append()**, delete them with **remove() or pop()**, and loop through the list to display everything in an organized way.
- I discovered how to open and work with text files in Python for saving data permanently.
- I learned how to write tasks into a file and later read them back, ensuring that my tasks remain even after I close and restart the program.
- I understood how to split program into multiple small functions to make it neat and reusable.
- Learned to write separate functions for loading, saving, adding, removing, and viewing tasks, to keep the code well-structured and easy to manage.
- Learned how to create a menu-driven program where users can choose what they want to do.
- Using if-elif-else conditions, built an easy-to-follow menu that allowed users to view, add, or remove tasks with clear instructions.
- I realized the importance of using a while True loop for creating interactive programs, this loop allowed the application to keep running and showing the menu until the user decided to exit, making it more user-friendly.
- I learned how to validate user inputs to prevent errors and crashes, for example, when the user entered a wrong task number or typed something invalid, learned to handled it gracefully using try-except, showing helpful error messages instead of stopping the program.
- I learned to use Pythonâ€™s enumerate() function to display tasks with serial numbers, this made it easy for users to identify tasks by number, which simplified the process of removing a specific task.
